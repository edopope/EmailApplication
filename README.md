# EmailApplication
An email application with basic  CRUD methods and email capabilities
To use the application you would need to have an apikey from sendinblue(now brevo)

input this in the secrets.properties--> sendinblue.mail.url=https://api.sendinblue.com/v3/smtp/email
and mail.api.key=(your ApiKey)
